        Will You Be My Valentine?

    <div class="message">
        My most esteemed and beloved Sister,
        <br>
        <br>
        I write to you under circumstances of the gravest importance, 
        for my heart is weighed down by a question that simply cannot 
        wait another moment. Pray forgive the boldness of this 
        correspondence, but Valentine’s Day approaches with an alarming 
        swiftness, and I find myself unwilling to face it without you.
        <br>
        <br>
        It is my sincerest hope—nay, my fervent wish—that you might 
        consent to be my Valentine. Such an honor would fill me with joy 
        beyond measure, for who else could possibly rival you in wit, 
        loyalty, and excellence of sisterly devotion? To spend the day in 
        your company would, I am convinced, render all other Valentines 
        utterly insignificant.
        <br>
        <br>
        Should you accept, I vow to provide unwavering affection, 
        excessive compliments, and at least one act of mild foolishness 
        in your name. Should you decline… I fear I may perish dramatically 
        (or at the very least complain about it for several business days).
        <br>
        <br>
        I await your answer with bated breath and an overabundance of sentiment.
        <br>
        <br>
        Yours in eternal sisterhood,
        <br>
        Deblina 💌
